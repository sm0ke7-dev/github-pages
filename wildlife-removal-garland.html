                <p>Humane wildlife removal complies with laws and prioritizes animal welfare. Ethical treatment reduces animal suffering, limits disease risks, and supports local ecosystems by safely relocating wildlife. This approach balances effective removal with conservation, fostering coexistence between humans and nature.</p>

                <div class="success-box">
                    <h4>Advantages of Humane Removal Methods</h4>
